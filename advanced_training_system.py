Advanced Doodle Jump AI Training System

This system combines all the latest improvements including:
- Enhanced reward systems with multi-objective optimization
- Curriculum learning with adaptive difficulty
- Prioritized experience replay
- Advanced neural networks (Dueling DQN, Noisy Networks)
- Real-time analytics and performance tracking
- Automatic model checkpointing and evaluation
